# Detecting-usefulness-of-Yelp-Reviews
Term Project for SNLP course Autumn 2017

# Dataset
The data used is the publicly released data by Yelp as part of the Yelp Dataset challenge. The data can be obtained [here](https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge).

# Instructions

* Download the data from the yelp website
* Go to the pre-processing folder and follow the instructions given in the README file in that folder
* Extract LIWC features for the text (Note: LIWC features are proprietary. The code for the feature extraction is hence not included)
* Use the 'Many_Classifiers.py' file in the 'source' folder to run different models and see their accuracies. Also run 'Observing_dist.py' to see where misclassification occurs.

You can read the project report (report.pdf) to have a clear idea of our approach and our results.
